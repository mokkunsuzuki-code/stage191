# QSP v2.0 — Quantum-Safe Protocol

QSP v2.0 is a research-oriented, open protocol that combines
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
under explicitly stated security assumptions.

This release is intended for:
- interoperability experiments,
- reproducible security evaluation,
- and collaborative PoC with research institutes and industry.

## 🔐 Security Posture (Important)

QSP v2.0 does NOT claim "absolute security".

Instead, it explicitly documents:
- which security properties are claimed,
- under which assumptions,
- and which aspects are left for PoC or future validation.

See:
👉 docs/Stage172-A-Impl-Formal-Mapping.md

## Intended Use

- Research and evaluation of PQC/QKD hybrid key exchange
- Interoperability testing between independent implementations
- PoC with real or emulated QKD systems

This release is NOT intended for immediate production deployment.
